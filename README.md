# Rain Prediction in Australia
This repository contains a project that aims to predict rain in Australia using a dataset from Kaggle. The project involves the use of various classifiers to predict tomorrow’s rain based on previous days’ information from different locations. A key focus of this project is to improve prediction metrics, especially accuracy.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in Australia by training models on a dataset of weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. The dataset includes daily weather observations from various locations in Australia.

## Classifiers Used
In this project, we have used various classifiers to make predictions. These classifiers are trained on the dataset and then used to predict whether it will rain tomorrow. The performance of these classifiers is then compared to find the most accurate model.

## Metric Improvement
A significant part of this project is dedicated to improving the accuracy of the predictions. This involves fine-tuning the parameters of the classifiers, feature selection, and other techniques to enhance the model’s performance.

## How to Use
Clone this repository.
Run the Python script on the Rain in Australia dataset from Kaggle.

Please note that this project is finished. Even though suggestions are welcome!
